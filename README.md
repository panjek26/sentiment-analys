# Sentiment Analysis using Naive Bayes

## Introduction

A dataset of sample tweets is taken from the NLTK library and used to create a sentiment analysis model. The model is built using a **Naive Bayes Classifier** trained on a dataset of positive and negative tweets after preprocessing. The model takes a list of text tokens (that make up a comment) as input and predicts whether the corresponding comment is positive or negative.
